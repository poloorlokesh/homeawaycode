Frameworks used:

Notes/Issues:

By default the browser is firefox. if you want to use the different browser we need to have driver.exe in drivers folder.
I have driver for mac in the same driver folder, rest of the OS please download the drivers.

For ordering the item in http://store.demoqa.com, created the user.
Username : homeawayuser
Password : homeaway@12
You can change the user credentials in the config.properties file.

Problems faced: 
Update user Profile details page doesnâ€™t work properly.
Always some details not getting saved while updating. Checked manually with different browsers as well.
I have created the testcase validations based on the mandatory files in the user profile page.
So testcase validation might fail as per website behavior.


For code analysis and specification attached two files with observations.
